# Convex Project

This project implements and compares several optimization algorithms ‚Äî including SGD, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam ‚Äî using manual implementations in PyTorch.

We analyze the convergence behavior of each optimizer on both:
- Synthetic objective functions (e.g., Quadratic, Rosenbrock, and Rastrigin)
- Image classification tasks (e.g., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST)

## üìÅ Files

- `convex_project-3.py`: Main script containing optimizer implementations and experimental setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
